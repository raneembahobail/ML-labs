# This dataset contains information about 100,000 university students, including their lifestyle habits, study routines, and mental well-being. The goal is to analyze how these factors affect academic performance (CGPA) and mental health (depression and stress). Depending on the focus, the problem can be framed as a regression task (predicting CGPA), a classification task (identifying students at risk of mental health issues), or a clustering task (finding patterns in student lifestyles)
